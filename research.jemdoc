== Distributionally Robust Planning of Low-Carbon Power Systems

The transition to low-carbon power systems is challenged by the spatial mismatch between renewable resources and load centers, as well as the inherent volatility of wind and solar generation. This research stream addresses the need for coordinated infrastructure planning, specifically the joint sizing and siting of renewable generation, energy storage systems (ESS), and transmission lines. A core methodological innovation in this work is the departure from traditional stochastic programming, which assumes perfect knowledge of probability distributions. Instead, this research employs distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to construct ambiguity sets that capture the inexactness of empirical data. By reformulating problems into tractable programs, these works balance investment costs against operational risks, such as renewable curtailment and load shedding. The frameworks extend to address physical realities like the wake effect in wind farms and policy constraints such as carbon taxes, providing a robust roadmap for designing reliable, zero-carbon energy systems.

== Real-Time Operation, Market Mechanisms & Distributed Flexibility

As distributed energy resources (DERs) proliferate, the operational paradigm must shift to real-time coordination. This research category focuses on the management of diverse assets, including microgrids, electric vehicle (EV) fleets, data centers, and pulsed loads on all-electric ships. A key focus is the development of online algorithms and market mechanisms that incentivize participation while adhering to physical constraints. For instance, novel frameworks for real-time energy sharing among prosumers are modeled as generalized Nash games, ensuring fair equilibrium. By employing techniques such as Lyapunov optimization and Fourier series approximations, these strategies enable sub-second decision-making for high-power applications, ensuring systems remain stable, cost-effective, and low-carbon in real-time environments.

== New Robust Optimization Paradigm: Decision-Dependent Uncertainty & Integrated Prediction-Optimization

In modern power system operations, the separation between forecasting and decision-making often leads to suboptimal dispatch strategies. This research category bridges that gap by investigating decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), where the operator's decisions, such as purchasing distributed forecasts or setting unit commitments, endogenously alter the underlying uncertainty sets. Moving beyond the traditional predict-then-optimize paradigm, this work introduces predict-and-optimize frameworks that integrate forecasting models directly into the optimization loop. This approach allows for the valuation of information, where the system operator can strategically purchase local predictions from agents to shrink uncertainty sets and reduce conservatism. By establishing theoretical guarantees for convergence and optimality, these models offer a closed-loop solution for economic dispatch and unit commitment that is statistically robust and operationally efficient.
